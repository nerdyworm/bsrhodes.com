    <h1>Hi I'm Ben</h1>

    <p>It is a pleasure to meet you.</p>

    <p>
      My entire life I have been building and learning all types of things 
      from wood cabinets and funky coffee tables to distributed software systems.
      I have throughly enjoyed every moment of it.  My life would be completely
      different had I not been driven by my curiosity of the unknown. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I am a formally educated computer scientist.  I began this journey being a 
      self taught programmer but later learned the hard way that there were
      better ways to solve these problems and better math to describe them.  I have also
      come to realize that there is no replacement for experience, this is why
      I learn something new and try something new everyday. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I like to solve problems at <a href="http://coderloop.com">coderloop</a>,
      get inspired by <a href="http://dribbble.com/">dribble</a>, and kick back to some 
      music with <a href="http://discovertrance.com/">trance radio</a>.  I couldn't possibly
      list all the places I wander but those are a few of my favorites that I want to share 
      with you.
