      <p><a href="http://illbeout.com">Illbeout</a>, Leave, Vacation, and Time off management in the cloud.</p> 
      <p>A new project that will be targeting people that hate calling out sick for work and the bosses that hate having to tell everyone else in the office that your going to be out and the HR folks that hate that no one writes this information down.  Perhaps I should narrow the scope to hipsters with iPhones that was a sleek way to take the day off.</p>

    <div  class="grid_7"> 
      <p>A while back I decided to convert my wordpress blog to my own personal rails project.  Well this project has evolved into what I now call pooky.</p> 
      <p>Pooky is powered by Rails, MongoDB, GridFS, and Liquid Templates.  This allows me the flexibility to customize every editor field to suit the needs of the content.  By leveraging the power of a document oriented database I am able to store things in a logic manor without the burden of a ridiculous relational database join system.</p>

      <p>smrks is a simple to use and organize bookmark site.  This project was aimed at creating a private bookmarking site that didn&#8217;t have frivolously features of social networks.  The best feature of the project is the bookmarklet.  It allows you to bookmark a site without having to open a new window.</p>

    <div  class="grid_7"> 
      <p><a href="http://weeklr.com/">weeklr.com</a> was my first rails project. The goal of this project was to create a simple todo list that a friend had dreamt up. a secondary goal was to create a test application to weigh the benefits of using ruby on rails over <span class="caps">php</span> frameworks or grails. so far the jury is still hung but there is still much to learn.</p>

    <div  class="grid_7"> 
      <p><a href="http://pookyping.info">pooky ping</a> is a basic http request based monitor system. it tracks parameters like response time that follows the health of your server.  it organizes all the data it collects into easy-to-read graphs, and even notifies the administrator by email if the server becomes unresponsive.  we use simple monitor on our website and any we administrate.</p>
